# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for AoC 2022. I intend to complete each day's problems in a different programming language (a.k.a. the
polyglot challenge). Most of the solutions here are optimized for development time, so efficiency and
readability/maintainability generally aren't concerns. I swear, most of the time my code looks a _lot_ nicer than this.

## Completed Problems

[Day 1: Ruby](./day01_ruby)  
[Day 2: Prolog (GNU Prolog)](./day02_prolog)  
[Day 3: MATLAB (GNU Octave)](./day03_octave)  
[Day 4: OCaml](./day04_ocaml)  
[Day 5: C++](./day05_cpp)  
[Day 6: x86_64 Assembly](./day06_x86)  
[Day 7: D](./day07_d)  
[Day 8: Fortran](./day08_fortran)  
[Day 9: R](./day09_r)  
[Day 10: Zig](./day10_zig)  
[Day 11: Java](./day11_java)  
[Day 12: Go](./day12_go)  
[Day 13: JavaScript](./day13_javascript)  
[Day 14: Lua](./day14_lua)  
[Day 15: Lisp](./day15_lisp)  
[Day 16: Python](./day16_python)  
[Day 17: C](./day17_c)  
[Day 18: Bash](./day18_bash)
