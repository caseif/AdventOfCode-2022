# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for AoC 2022. I intend to complete each day's problems in a different programming language (a.k.a. the
polyglot challenge), but we'll see how that pans out (i.e. whether I can find enough time each day).

## Completed Problems

[Day 1: Ruby](./day1_ruby)  
[Day 2: Prolog](./day2_prolog)

## Candidate Languages (tentative)

- Bash
- BASIC
- C
- C++
- C#
- CoffeeScript
- D
- Fortran
- Go
- Groovy
- Haskell
- Java
- JavaScript

- Lisp
- Lua
- MATLAB/Octave
- OCaml
- PHP
- Python
