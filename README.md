# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for AoC 2022. I intend to complete each day's problems in a different programming language (a.k.a. the
polyglot challenge). Most of the solutions here are optimized for development time, so efficiency and
readability/maintainability generally aren't concerns. I swear, most of the time my code looks a _lot_ nicer than this.

## Completed Problems

[Day 1: Ruby](./day1_ruby)  
[Day 2: Prolog (GNU Prolog)](./day2_prolog)  
[Day 3: MATLAB (GNU Octave)](./day3_octave)  
[Day 4: OCaml](./day4_ocaml)  
[Day 5: C++](./day5_cpp)  
[Day 6: x86_64 Assembly](./day6_x86)  
[Day 7: D](./day7_d)  
[Day 8: Fortran](./day8_fortran)  
[Day 9: R](./day9_r)  
[Day 10: Zig](./day10_zig)  
[Day 11: Java](./day11_java)
