# Day 7: D

Wow, D is quite the breath of fresh air after yesterday's fiasco. I've briefly looked into the language in the past, but
this was my first time programming with it in earnest and I have to say, I'm really impressed. The syntax is really nice
and extremely intuitive, and it feels a lot like writing in a managed language like C# or Java. As a programmer, I'm
self-taught primarily via Java and I currently spend 75% of my day writing C#, and as a result I was able to pretty much
fumble my way through writing the program while only needing to consult the docs sparingly for less common syntactic
patterns and specific function names.

I chose D for today's problem because it's about as perfect fit for an OO solution as you can get (and I didn't want to
burn Java or C# on a day when I actually have some time to experiment). It was really a blast to work with and I'll
definitely be considering it for future projects if the fit is right.
