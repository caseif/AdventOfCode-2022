# Day 1: Ruby

Day 1's problems solved in Ruby. With these problems being pretty straightforward and Ruby being pretty terrific for
doing per-line processing, this day was a breeze. Part B was especially nice because I was able to pretty much just tack
the `sort!` and `reverse!` calls onto my part A solution and spit out both answers.

I did find myself having to quickly brush up on lambda syntax since Ruby has a fairly unique syntax (at least compared
to languages I use day-to-day); meanwhile, I think the last project I wrote from scratch in Ruby was around a year and a
half ago.
